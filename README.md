# Save Backup Tool (DarkSouls2_Saves)
This is a software that allows a user to make backup saves in Dark Souls 2 (and probably other games with this save system). It can be found and downloaded from [nexusmods](http://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/675/?). Should the link be dead, the program exists under the name "Save Backup Tool" in category "Utilities".

## About Repository
The program was written back in days when I was starting with git, thus it didn't have a correct repository. That's why it has only initial commit with all the files.
